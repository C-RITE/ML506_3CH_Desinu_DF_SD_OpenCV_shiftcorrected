Source Files
=============
  - pcmcia_lib.c      
        Implementation of a library for accessing PCI devices using
        WinDriver's WDC API. The library's API is used by the user-mode 
        application (pcmcia_diag).
        
  - pcmcia_lib.h
        Header file for the pcmcia_lib library

  - pcmcia_diag.c
        Implementation of a sample diagnostics CUI application, which
        demonstrates communication with a PCI device using the pcmcia_lib
        and WDC libraries.
        The sample also demonstrates how to communicate with a Kernel PlugIn 
        driver from a user-mode WinDriver application.
