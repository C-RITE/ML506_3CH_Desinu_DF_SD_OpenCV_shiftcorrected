WDREG

This file contains:
1. An overview of the wdreg sample.
2. The contents of the wdreg/ directory.
3. Instructions for compiling the wdreg sample.
4. Guidelines for converting wdreg from a console-mode (CUI)
   application to a graphical (GUI) application.


1. Overview
   =========
   The wdreg sample can be used to dynamically load and unload the WinDriver
   kernel module as well as Kernel PlugIn drivers you create on Windows.

   On Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 the sample can also be used to install
   device-INF files, thereby replacing the slower manual installation
   process using Windows' Device Manager (which can still be used).

   For Windows 2000/XP the wdreg utility is provided in two forms: WDREG and
   WDREG_GUI. Both utilities can be run from the command line, and provide
   the same functionality. The difference is that WDREG_GUI displays
   installation messages graphically, while WDREG displays them in console mode.
   For Windows 98/Me the WDREG16 16-bit version of this utility is provided.
   Pre-compiled executables of all versions of this utility can be found under
   the WinDriver\utils directory.
   
   For a detailed description of the wdreg utility (in its different forms)
   and its usage, refer to the WinDriver User's Manuals (found under the
   WinDriver/docs/ directory).

   - ui.cpp
         User interface library.

   - ui.h
         A header file for the ui.cpp user interface library.

   - files.txt
        Describes the sample files.
 
   - wdreg16.mak
     Makefile for building the 16-bit version of the sample (wdreg16.exe).
   
   - wdreg16.def
     Definitions file for building the 16-bit version of the sample
     (wdreg16.exe).

   - x86/ directory - Windows x86 32-bit files:
     - msdev_6/ sub-directory:
       - wdreg.dsp
             MSDEV 6.0 project file
       - wdreg.dsw
             MSDEV 6.0 workspace file
  
  - WIN32/ sub-directory:
    - wdreg.exe
          The compiled sample program for Windows
    
    You can find the GUI version of this utility (wdreg_gui.exe) and the
    16-bit version (wdreg16.exe) under the WinDriver\utils directory.


3. Compiling the sample:
   =====================
 - Compiling the 32-bit wdreg.exe utility (for Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003):
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To compile wdreg.exe for Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 you need the Windows
   Driver Development Kit (DDK).
   The provided sample MSDEV project (see above) was created for the Windows
   2k DDK. In order to build the sample using a different version of the DDK
   you will need to modify the sample project file.

   To build the sample:
   
   1) Install the Windows DDK and set the BASEDIR environment variable to the
      location of your DDK library.

   2) Open the msdev_6\wdreg.dsw workspace file with MSDEV, set the active
      build configuration for the wdreg.dsp project to your target build
      (e.g. WIN32 - win2k free) and build the project from the IDE.

 - Compiling the 16-bit wdreg16.exe utility (for Windows 98/Me):
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   To compile wdreg16.exe for Windows 98/Me you need the Windows 98
   Driver Development Kit (DDK).

   To build the sample:
   
   1) Install the Windows 98 DDK and define the MSVC152 (compiler's directory)
      and DDKROOT (Windows 98 DDK directory) environment variables.

   2) Build the sample by running the following command from the command line:
      NMAKE /f wdreg16.mak
