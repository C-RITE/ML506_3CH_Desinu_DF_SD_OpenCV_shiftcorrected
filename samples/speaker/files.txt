The source code for this project was generated by WinDriver Wizard.
To compile this application, you will need a Win32 compiler.

Files:
  speaker.c
      The main file which demonstrates access to the speaker,
      using speaker_lib.c.
  speaker_lib.c
      A library for accessing the speaker on the motherboard
      directly.
  speaker_lib.h
      Header file of speaker_lib.c library.
  speaker.mak
      MS-Visual C++ 4.0 (and above) compatible make file.
  speaker.mdp
      MS-Visual C++ 4.0 (and above) compatible project file.
  files.txt
      Describes the files generated.

Compiling this project:
  If you are using MS-Visual C++, then open the speaker.mdp project file, and
  compile.

  If using a different compiler:
  - Create a new project. Choose console mode project.
  - Include the following files in the project:
      speaker.c
      speaker_lib.c

Converting to a GUI application:
  This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than
  a GUI application) that uses standard input and standard output.
  This was done in order to simplify the source code. You may change it
  into a GUI application by removing all calls to printf() and scanf()
  functions, and calling MessageBox() instead.
