1. Overview
   =========
   The pci_dump sample provides a dump of all the PCI configuration
   registers of the installed PCI cards.

3. Compiling the sample:
   =====================
   To compile and build the sample application you need an appropriate C/C++
   compiler for your development platform.

   - On Windows: If you are using one of the supported MSDEV or Borland C++
     Builder IDEs (see above): open the sample project/workspace/solution
     file from the relevant compiler sub-directory and simply build the project.
    
   - On Windows CE: If you are using MS eMbedded Visual C++ or MS Platform
     Builder: open the sample project/workspace file from the relevant
     compiler sub-directory (see above) and simply build the project.
     
     NOTES:
     - To build the WinCE eMbedded Visual C++ project you need to have a
       corresponding target SDK.
     - To build the WinCE Platform Builder project you need to have a
       corresponding BSP (Board Support Package) for the target platform.

   - On Linux/Solaris: If you are using GNU make, simply build the sample
     using the makefile from the LINUX/ or SOLARIS/ sub-directory
     (respectively).
    
   - If you are using a different C/C++ compiler or make utility:
     - Create a new console mode project/makefile for your compiler.
     - Add the following files to the project/makefile:
       WinDriver/samples/pci_dump/pci_dump.c
       WinDriver/samples/shared/wdc_diag_lib.c
       WinDriver/samples/shared/diag_lib.c
     - Link your project with the WinDriver/lib/wdapi<version>.lib (Windows /
       Windows CE) or WinDriver/lib/libwdapi<version>.so (Linux / Solaris) OR
       add the following files (which are exported in the wdapi<version> DLL /
       shared object) to your project/makefile:
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/utils.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_int_thread.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_events.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/status_strings.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_general.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_cfg.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_mem_io.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_ints.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_events.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_err.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_dma.c
     - Build your project.


4. Converting to a GUI application:
   ================================
   This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than a GUI
   application) that uses standard input and standard output.
   This was done in order to simplify the source code. You can change the
   sample into a GUI application by replacing all calls to <stdio.h> functions
   such as printf(), sprintf(), scanf(), etc. with relevant GUI functions and
   replacing the main() function in pci_dump.c with a GUI equivalent.
