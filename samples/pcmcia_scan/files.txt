PCMCIA_SCAN

This file contains:
1. An overview of the pcmcia_scan sample.
2. The contents of the pcmcia_scan/ directory.
3. Instructions for compiling the pcmcia_scan sample.
4. Guidelines for converting pcmcia_scan from a console-mode (CUI)
   application to a graphical (GUI) application.


1. Overview
   =========
   The pcmcia_scan sample scans the PCMCIA bus for the installed PCMCIA
   cards and displays the resources of the detected cards.


2. Files
   ======
   This section describes the sub-directories and files provided under the
   pcmcia_scan/ directory.
   
   The source code was created by Jungo using WinDriver's API.

   - pcmcia_scan.c
         The main file, which implements the sample.

   - files.txt
        Describes the sample files.

3. Compiling the sample:
   =====================
   To compile and build the sample application you need an appropriate C/C++
   compiler for your development platform.

   - If you are using one of the supported MSDEV or Borland C++ Builder IDEs
     (see above): open the pcmcia_diag project/workspace/solution file from
     the relevant compiler sub-directory and simply build the project.

   - If you are using a different C/C++ compiler or make utility:
     - Create a new console mode project/makefile for your compiler.
     - Add the following files to the project/makefile:
       WinDriver/samples/pcmcia_scan/pcmcia_scan.c
       WinDriver/samples/shared/wdc_diag_lib.c
       WinDriver/samples/shared/diag_lib.c
     - Link your project with the WinDriver/lib/wdapi<version>.lib (Windows /
       Windows CE) or WinDriver/lib/libwdapi<version>.so (Linux / Solaris) OR
       add the following files (which are exported in the wdapi<version> DLL /
       shared object) to your project/makefile:
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/utils.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_int_thread.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/windrvr_events.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/status_strings.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_general.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_cfg.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_mem_io.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_ints.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_events.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_err.c
       WinDriver/src/wdapi/wdc_dma.c
     - Build your project.


4. Converting to a GUI application:
   ================================
   This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than a GUI
   application) that uses standard input and standard output.
   This was done in order to simplify the source code. You can change the
   sample into a GUI application by replacing all calls to <stdio.h> functions
   such as printf(), sprintf(), scanf(), etc. with relevant GUI functions and
   replacing the main() function in pcmcia_scan.c with a GUI equivalent.
