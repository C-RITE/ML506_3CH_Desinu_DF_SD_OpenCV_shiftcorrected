Source Files
=============
  - pci_lib.c      
        Implementation of a library for accessing PCI devices using
        WinDriver's WDC API. The library's API is used both by the user-mode
        application (pci_diag) and by the Kernel PlugIn driver (kp_pci).
        
  - pci_lib.h
        Header file for the pci_lib library.

  - pci_diag.c
        Implementation of a sample diagnostics CUI application, which
        demonstrates communication with a PCI device using the pci_lib
        and WDC libraries.
        The sample also demonstrates how to communicate with a Kernel PlugIn 
        driver from a user-mode WinDriver application.

   - kp_pci/
   
     - kp_pci.c
           Implementation of a sample WinDriver PCI Kernel PlugIn driver, which 
           demonstrates how to communicate with PCI devices from the kernel 
           using WinDriver's API and the WDC library.
